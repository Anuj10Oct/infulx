	Time Series data is sequence of data points, typically consisting of succesive measurements made from the same source over the time interval.
		1) Regular time series
		2) Irregular time series (events)
				Events become regular time intervals, for example
					a) Summarizing the average trade price of Apple Stock every 10 minutes over the course of the day
					b) Summarizing the average response time for requests in the application over 1 minute intervals
					
	Uniqueness of time series WORKLOAD
		1) Life cyle management -> we can retire old data or compress it and put somewhere else.
		2) Summarization -> easy to summarize last hour max value or in a year max value
		3) Large range scan of many records
		
	Primary use cases
		1) IOT -> oil, gas , sensors, metres
		2) DevOps -> severs, VMs, applications, users or events
		3) Real Time analytics -> apps that instrument bussiness, social or development metrics in real time.
		
	Why Choose Influx DB
		1) No external dependenices
		2) Allow for regular or irregular time series
		3) Horizontallly scalable
		4) Member of a cohesive time series plateform.
		
	InfluxDB data modal
		1) Measurement : use of call label e.g. stock price
		2) Tags: use to call these the legend(meta data). Tags are indexed values.
		3) tagset : collection of all tags
		4) fields :  Y-Axis values. Note that that are fields stores can be floats,ints, strings, or bools
		5) fieldset : collection of fields
		6) timestamp : X-Axis values
		
	How do we repersent points textually ?
		- the Line protocol
			measurement,tagset fieldset timestamp
		e.g :- 1) stock_price,ticker=A,market=NASDAQ price=177.33 144500045897
			   2) temprature,zipcode=94107,country=usa value=17,humidity =10
							if we don't have timestamp, then sever willtake receive time as timestam for that line.
		- A series in Influx DB
			measurment + tagset = the series as a whole
			measurement + tagset + timestamp = singlepoint			
			
	Writing data into influx DB
		1) Create Database
			> create database mydb
			
		2) Verifying the database was creted or not
			> show databases
			
		3) Use database
			use mydb
			
		4) insert data into mydb database
			insert cpu,host=server1,location=us-west value=10
			insert cpu,host=server1,location=us-west value=15
			insert cpu,host=server2,location=us-west value=8
			
		5) verifying the data was written
			a) Select * from cpu
			b) show series
			c) show measurements
